# AFK LAN Event

My project is based off LAN Events, where profesional players from all over the world can come together and play video games together and against eachother under the same network.
My Event is called "AFK", which is an abbreviation for "Away From Keyboard". The project focuses on giving information to the user about an upcoming event and allowing them to book
tickets to the event so that they can attend and spectate profesional players compete against eachother for money in various video games.
